Description: The package provides utilities for simulating the assessment of
    land-cover state and change through a global sampling grid. The main focus is
    on studying the influence of particular desing parameters, such as sample size
    and the size and shape of different observation units, on the outcome of sample-
    based land-cover assessments.
